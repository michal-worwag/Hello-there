![Hello there](https://github.com/michal-worwag/Hello-there/blob/master/Hello%20there.jpg?raw=true)

And you now say: General Kenobi :) But no I'm not General (maybe in some sort of games). My name is Michal and I'm looking for a job as Front-end Developer.)

If you're reading this, you've probably got my CV and maybe you're interested in hiring me or at least talking to me.
In this account you will find my previous work. One better the other worse, but I keep learning and try to eliminate errors, improve the code that I write and expand my knowledge.

If you came here accidentally, and you were interested in the things found on this profile and you would like to talk about them, then below are my contact details, so write boldly :)
